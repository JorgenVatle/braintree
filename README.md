# BrainTreeConnect #

A wrapper for Meteor style synchronous Braintree API calls.

# NOTE #
With Meteor versions >= 1.3 you should now use the npm package directly found [here](https://www.npmjs.com/package/braintree)

## Example Usage ##

```javascript

try{
    var bt = BrainTreeConnect({
      //If you set an ENV variable for PRODUCTION you can dynamically change out sandbox and production
      environment: process.env.PRODUCTION && Braintree.Environment.Production || Braintree.Environment.Sandbox,
      merchantId: Meteor.settings.BRAIN_TREE.MERCHANT_ID,
      publicKey:  Meteor.settings.BRAIN_TREE.PUBLIC_KEY,
      privateKey: Meteor.settings.BRAIN_TREE.PRIVATE_KEY
    });
    return bt.customer.create(config);
} catch(error){
    throw new Meteor.Error(1001, error.message);
}
```

## Client API ##
In case you are wanting to use the client API to create the nonce token you should include the following script in your `head.html` file 
```html
<script src="https://js.braintreegateway.com/v2/braintree.js"></script>
```

## Webhooks (Example)

This example uses Iron Router but you can you any server side routing package
```es6
    Router.route('receiveMerchantUpdate', function () {
    
          // NodeJS request object
          var request = this.request;
    
          // NodeJS  response object
          var response = this.response;
    
          var bt_challenge = request.query.bt_challenge;
    
          var bt = BrainTreeConnect({
            environment: process.env.PRODUCTION && Braintree.Environment.Production || Braintree.Environment.Sandbox,
            merchantId: Meteor.settings.BRAIN_TREE.MERCHANT_ID,
            publicKey: Meteor.settings.BRAIN_TREE.PUBLIC_KEY,
            privateKey: Meteor.settings.BRAIN_TREE.PRIVATE_KEY
          });
  
          //If we are verifying the webhook
          if(bt_challenge) {
            return response.end(bt.webhookNotification.verify(bt_challenge));
          } else {
          
    //Decode the request and perform the needed logic for the type of request
     bt.webhookNotification.parse(request.body.bt_signature, request.body.bt_payload, function (err, webhookNotifiction) {
              switch(webhookNotifiction.kind) {
    
                //Sub Merchant was Approved
                case Braintree.WebhookNotification.Kind.SubMerchantAccountApproved:
    
                  //Find and Update the user
                  Meteor.users.update({ 'profile.merchantAccount.id' :  webhookNotifiction.merchantAccount.id }, { $set : {
                    'profile.merchantAccount' : webhookNotifiction.merchantAccount
                  }});
    
                  console.log('Success');
                  break;
    
                //Supplier was declined
                case Braintree.WebhookNotification.Kind.SubMerchantAccountDeclined:
                  console.log('Failed');
                  break;
              }
    
            });
    
            return response.end();
          }
        },
        {
          where: 'server',
          path: 'hooks/processor/merchants'
        });
```
